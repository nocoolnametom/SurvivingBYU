## Introduction

Welcome to BYU!  Is it everything you hoped it would be?  Of course not, you were sold an image by the recruiters and/or loved ones that was intended to get you here.  Now you're here and you can see that BYU is, for the most part, just another college campus.

It's the parts _not_ within that "for the most part" that tend to throw people for a loop.  The culture seems homogenous, the Honor Code is about so much more minutae than intellectual and scholastic honesty, and your life is expected to be managed like you were still a kid in junior high school.

You're in college now!  You're on your own!  These are supposed to be the years of your life that you explore who you are and become an adult.  So it can chafe when you are still treated like a child.

For some of you (an increasing number over the past decade) the problems are deeper than just a cultural fit.  You may have lost all belief in the faith claims of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Perhaps not, but this manual is going to assume that people who occupy the various closets are the ones who are going to have some of the most difficult times at "the BYU".  Whether that closet is being an Exmormon, non-heterosexual, transgender, or many other aspects of the human experience that can't be fully expressed in common BYU culture, this manual can hopefully help you get through your time on campus over the next few years.  Or perhaps even less time than that should you choose to transfer your credits to another university: we'll cover that process, too.

Brigham Young University _can_ be a place where you can have fun, learn to grow up, and gain a good education in some fields (other fields not so much, but we'll go over that later).  With a perspective on what the rules of the "game" are, you can learn how to play by their rules but still find some freedom to live life by your own.

## A Game Without Clear Rules

You may think it odd that BYU could be described as a game without clear rules.  "What are yoy talking about?" I can hear you asking, "There are rules _everywhere!"_

Yes, there are rules everywhere.  Or what appear to be rules.  Take a look closely at some of those "rules":

 * Cougars don't cut corners.
 * Don't let your commitment come up short.
 * A close shave is a good thing on test day!
 * The Cougareat will be closed at 11:00 am on Tuesdays.

What do these statements have in common?  At first glance they appear to be about rules, but notice: each one of them is about encouraging conformity.  There _are_ real rules before them but they are presented in a way that asks you to live in conformity.  Look at how the rules feel when they are phrased in a straight-forward way:

 * Don't walk on the grass.
 * Don't wear shorts that run above your knees.
 * Keep yourself clean-shaven.
 * Go to the Devotionals.

You may not _like_ the rules and expectations, but without that friendly veneer do you at least feel a bit more respected?

That is lesson one: the rules for the game of BYU are often hidden.  They require a bit of work to find out. You'll need to learn to ignore the please for conformity in the rules as publicly presented to find out what the actual rule underneath is stating.

Once you learn to find out what the real rules are, you'll learn that there are three categories of actions:

 1. Things are are explicitly against the rules.
 2. Things that _might_ be against the rules depending on how much of a stick is up the ass of the person enforcing them.
 3. Things not against the rules.

You'll want to learn what actions occupy that third category because that is the category that will relieve the maddening monotomy of BYU.  This manual will also discuss way that you can break the rules, too, if you want to but it's on your own head if you get caught (remember that you found this manual and it's certainly likely that the Honor Code office has found it as well).
